;; This module defines a manager state object, which is used to keep track of the
;; workers and tasks currently being managed by the manager.
;;
;; The general structure is:
;;
;; - opaque-manager-state
;;   - worker-lookup (hash of worker-identifier? -> opaque-worker-state)
;; - opaque-worker-state
;;   - worker (worker?)
;;   - task-lookup (hash of gen:task-identifer? -> gen:task-handle)
